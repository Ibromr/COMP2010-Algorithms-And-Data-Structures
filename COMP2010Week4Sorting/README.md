# COMP2010: Algorithms and Data Structures
This repository contains my work throughout the semester for the COMP2010 course. It includes studies on fundamental algorithms, data structures, and programming techniques.

## Contents:
- Tree structures
- Graphs and heaps
- Advanced sorting techniques
- Storage management
- Algorithm complexity analysis

The presentations emphasize the role of data abstraction and correctness proofs.
